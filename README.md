# What is a Duplicate Image Detector?
Duplicate image detection refers to the process of identifying multiple instances of the same image within a set of images. This process involves analyzing and comparing images to find those that are visually identical or nearly identical, despite potential differences in file format, size, or minor edits.

This project provides a method for detecting duplicate images in a directory using the dHash algorithm. The script computes perceptual hashes for images and identifies duplicates based on matching hash values.

**You are free to use your own dataset as well**

# Features
- Detects duplicate images in a specified directory.
- Uses the dHash algorithm to compute perceptual hashes.
- Plots and displays the duplicate images.
- Also points out the file location for easy access.


# Usage
- Place the images you want to check for duplicates in a directory.
- Set the directory path variable in the script to the path of your library.
